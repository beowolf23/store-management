# üõí Store Management System

A Spring Boot-based microservices architecture designed for managing store operations. This project is a work in progress, showcasing a modular, scalable approach using a multi-module Maven setup.

## üì¶ Modules

The project is organized :

- **product-service**: Manages product-related operations, including CRUD functionality for products.
- **order-service**: Handles order creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **inventory-service**: Tracks and manages inventory levels.
- **payment-service**: Processes payments and handles transaction-related operations.
- **shared-lib**: Contains shared utilities, models, and configurations used across services.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up and run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.8.x or later
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- A running instance of Postgres Database (for development) or another compatible database

### Build the Project

To build all modules, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run a Service

Navigate to the desired service directory and start it with:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

For example, to run the product-service:

```bash
cd product-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## üß™ Testing the Product Service

The product-service is fully operational and ready for testing.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/products` | Retrieve a list of products |
| GET | `/api/products/{id}` | Retrieve a product by ID |
| POST | `/api/products` | Create a new product |
| PUT | `/api/products/{id}` | Update an existing product |

### Authentication

The product-service uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Use the following credentials:

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: adminpass

Include the Authorization header in your requests. Example using curl:

```bash
curl -u admin:adminpass http://localhost:8080/api/products
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot 3.4**: Framework for building microservices
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database operations
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment
